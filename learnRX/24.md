## Exercise 24: 
### Retrieve each video's id, title, middle moment time, and smallest box art url.
This is a variation of the problem we solved earlier. This time each video has an interesting moments collection, each representing a time during which a screenshot is interesting or representative of the title as a whole. Notice that both the boxarts and interestingMoments arrays are located at the same depth in the tree. Retrieve the time of the middle interesting moment and the smallest box art url simultaneously with zip().  

Return an {id, title, time, url} object for each video.

videos.id
videos.title
videos.boxarts.url
videos.interestingMoments


* `concatMap()` over `movieLists` (movieList)
* `concatMap()` over `videos` (video)
* `zip()` boxarts and interestingMoments arrays 
  - `reduce()` over `boxarts` (boxart) foer smallest
  - `filter()` over `interestingMoments` (type === "Middle")
  - combiner function that puts all the pieces together


```js
 return movieLists.
   concatMap( movieList => 
     movieList.videos.
       concatMap( video => 

         Array.zip( 
           video.boxarts.reduce( ( acc, curr) =>
             (acc.width*acc.height < curr.width*curr.height) ? acc : curr ), 
               video.interestingMoments.filter( interestingMoment =>
                 interestingMoment.type === "Middle" ), 
                   ( boxart, interestingMoment ) => 
                      ({id: video.id, title: video.title, time: interestingMoment.time, url: boxart.url })
        )
    )
  );

```
