## Exercise 17
### Retrieve the Largest Rating
Let's use our new reduce function to isolate the largest value in an array of ratings.

```js
function LargestRating() {
  var ratings = [2,3,1,4,5];
  return ratings.reduce((acc, curr) => {
    if (acc > curr) {
      return acc
    }
    else {
      return curr;
    } 
    });
}
```

* Declare variable `ratings`, an array 5 items long, each holding a number
* call `reduce()` on `ratings` passing in an anonymous callback (combiner function)
  - No initial value, so we start at the beginning and loop all the way through
  - Pass two arguments into combiner, `acc` and `curr` for accumulated and current value
* Loop through `ratings` and on each item
  - if the item is larger than the one before, return the larger item
  - on the final return, you've got the largest item in an array
