## Exercise 22
### Implement `zip()`
Let's add a static `zip()` function to the Array type. The `zip()` function accepts a combiner function, traverses each array at the same time, and calls the combiner function on the current item on the left-hand-side and right-hand-side.   

The `zip()` function requires an item from each array in order to call the combiner function, therefore the array returned by `zip()` will only be as large as the smallest input array.

```js
Array.zip = function(left, right, combinerFunction){
  var counter, results = [];
  
  for( counter = 0; counter < Math.min( left.length, right.length ); counter++){
    results.push( combinerFunction( left[ counter], right[ counter] ));
  }
  return results;
};
```
The combiner function takes a left array, and a right array and the two are always coordinated by the counter
