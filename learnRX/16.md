## Exercise 16
### Implement `reduce()` 
`reduce()` is for when you need to look at at least two values at the same time to do your job.   

Add the `reduce()` function to the Array prototype. This version differs from the `reduce()` built into JavaScript in that it returns the value inside an array. For example `[5]` instead of `5`.  
This makes it easy to continue chaining method calls. It also returns an empty array rather than an error if you attempt to reduce over an empty array.  

It also helps with asyncronous programming because you cant return a single value from an observable, as this would require you to block.  



```js
Array.prototype.reduce = function(combiner, initialValue) {
  var counter, accumulatedValue;
  if (this.length === 0) {
    return this;
  }
  else {
    if (arguments.length === 1) {
      counter = 1;
      accumulatedValue = this[0];
      else if {
        (arguments.length >= 2) {
          counter = 0;
          accumulatedValue = initialValue;
      } 
      else {
          throw "Invalid arguments.";
        }
  while (counter < this.length) {
    accumulatedValue = combiner(accumulatedValue, this[counter] )
    counter++;
  }
  return [accumulatedValue];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* If the array is empty, do nothing
* If the user didn't pass an initial value, use the first item.
* If there are two arguments (the first is `combiner` and second is `initalValue`)
  - set `counter` to 0, and
  - set `accumulatedValue` to the value of the the `initialValue`
* The first argument `combiner` is a function that takes in the `accumulated value`  and the current item in the array. 
* Loop through the array, feeding the current value and the result of the previous computation back into the `combiner` function until  we've exhausted the entire array and are left with only one item.
* Return the final `accumulatedValue` inside an array (one item long)
